Python Indentations ::
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Variables are containers for storing data values.Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

There are three numeric types in Python :
syntx : type()
int    - typeof int is <type 'int'> example : 1 , -1
float - typeof float is <type 'float'> example : 1.1 , 35e3 , 12E4 , -87.7e100
complex - typeof float is <type 'complex'> example : 1j , 1+1j , 1-1j

conversions : float(1) , int(2.8) , complex(1)
You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.

Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators :: +,-,*,/,%,**,//
Assignment operators :: =
Comparison operators :: ==,>=,<=
Logical operators :: and ,or ,not
Identity operators :: is , is not
Membership operators :: in , not in
Bitwise operators :: & , | , 


There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.

append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()	        Removes all the elements from the list
copy()		Returns a copy of the list
count()		Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()		Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()		Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()		Sorts the list
