Python Indentations ::
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, in Python the indentation is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Variables are containers for storing data values.Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

There are three numeric types in Python :
syntx : type()
int    - typeof int is <type 'int'> example : 1 , -1
float - typeof float is <type 'float'> example : 1.1 , 35e3 , 12E4 , -87.7e100
complex - typeof float is <type 'complex'> example : 1j , 1+1j , 1-1j

conversions : float(1) , int(2.8) , complex(1)
You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.

Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators :: +,-,*,/,%,**,//
Assignment operators :: =
Comparison operators :: ==,>=,<=
Logical operators :: and ,or ,not
Identity operators :: is , is not
Membership operators :: in , not in
Bitwise operators :: & , | , 


There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.

List properties - mutable
A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets.

append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()	        Removes all the elements from the list
copy()		Returns a copy of the list
count()		Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()		Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()		Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()		Sorts the list

Tuple properties - immutable
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.

count() returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

Set properties 
A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.
Sets are unordered, so the items will appear in a random order.
Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.

add()				Adds an element to the set
clear()				Removes all the elements from the set
copy()				Returns a copy of the set
difference()			Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
difference_update()		Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set
discard()			Remove the specified item
intersection()			Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets
intersection_update()		Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)
isdisjoint()			Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not
issubset()			Returns whether another set contains this set or not
issuperset()			Returns whether this set contains another set or not
pop()				Removes an element from the set
remove()			Removes the specified element
symmetric_difference()		Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets
symmetric_difference_update()	inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another
union()				Return a set containing the union of sets
update()			Update the set with the union of this set and others
